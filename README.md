# Project Title: Predictive Modeling for SpaceX Rocket Booster Landing Success
### Description:
In this project, I developed an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict the success of SpaceX rocket booster landings. The process involved:

  1. Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathering raw data from public APIs, web scraping (Wikipedia), followed by handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering. (In Progress)

  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends (correlations between launch conditions and landing outcomes) and deriving insights to guide modeling. (In Progress)

  3. Model Development: Training and tuning classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict landing success. (In Progress)

  4. Evaluation: Validating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision-recall. (In Progress)

Tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks
