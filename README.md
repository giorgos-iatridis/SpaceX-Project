# Project Title: Predictive Modeling for SpaceX Rocket Booster Landing Success
### Description:
In this project, I developed an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict the success of SpaceX rocket booster landings. The process involved:

  1. Data Collection: Gathering raw data from SpaceX API and Wikipedia.
  
  2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Transforming the data to the right form and handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

  3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends (correlations between features and landing outcomes) and deriving insights to guide modeling.

  4. Model Development: Training and tuning classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) to predict landing success.

  5. Evaluation: Validating performance using metrics like f1 score, accuracy, precision-recall.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn), Jupyter Notebooks
